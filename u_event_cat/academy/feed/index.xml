										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Erisman started working at Alibaba right after the tech bubble burst, and stayed there for more than eight years. He asked for Ma&#8217;s blessing before embarking on his journey to make the film, with the stipulation that the film would tell Alibaba&#8217;s story totally from his point of view, with no involvement from the company, highlighting not just its successes, but all the mistakes as well.</p>
<p>Ma gave him the green-light and over the next three years Erisman traveled around the world tracking down more than 200 hours of footage from 35 different sources and stitching it together. When he eventually showed Ma the finished product, his old boss was hard to read.</p>
<p>&#8220;I really couldn’t tell what his reaction was,&#8221; Erisman said. &#8220;I felt like he didn’t love it but that he didn’t hate it. I think that he thought it was fair.&#8221; About a year later, Ma called him up and asked if he would be willing to show it at the 10th anniversary of Taobao, Alibaba&#8217;s eBay-esque e-commerce site.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Wednesday evening, Apple executive Eddy Cue and Beats CEO Jimmy Iovine sat for an interview on stage at the Code Conference in Southern California. Cue said Apple bought Beats because &#8220;music is dying. It hasn&#8217;t been growing.&#8221; He said combining the two companies will help it grow again.</p>
<p>Cue said that the number of new releases on iTunes this past year are the smallest the company has ever seen, and that the growth in the number of songs sold through iTunes has &#8220;leveled off.&#8221; But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it?</p>
<p>But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure. He said that Beats has a great subscription music service and that Apple can make it a big business because it has a lot of customers, knows what those customers listen to, and has an easy way for them to pay for things. Cue said what makes Beats good is that it provides users with curated playlists.</p>
